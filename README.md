# MVC Project in C#

## Description

This project is a basic implementation of the **Model-View-Controller (MVC)** design pattern using **ASP.NET Core MVC**. It demonstrates the separation of concerns by structuring the application into models, views, and controllers. The purpose of this project is to provide a clean and organized approach to building scalable and maintainable web applications.

### Key Features:
- **Model**: Manages the data, logic, and rules of the application.
- **View**: Responsible for presenting data to the user in a readable format.
- **Controller**: Handles user input, manipulates the model, and renders the appropriate view.

This project includes user registration, login, and basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.

- **ASP.NET Core MVC**
- **C#**
- **Entity Framework Core** (for database interactions)
